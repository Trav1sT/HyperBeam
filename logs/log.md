Sprint review and retrospective| Now that the skeleton is done. Priority is to get a feature fully implement before proceeding to the next one. Starting from Quiz, then PDF upload and lastly Progress chart. All UI to be implemented first. Decide on using a demo screen for app frates that cannot be implemented yet due to lack of backend script. 
Newly added backlog:
-Allow user to upvote/ downvote answers (We stay true to our objective and will not provide model answers/ answers endorsed by tutor)
-Upload of pdf by Google drive (if most users use it) or support upload via other platforms and means too
