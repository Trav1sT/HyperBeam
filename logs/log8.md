### Sprint review and retrospective
Consolidated feedback from end user can serve as a direction of what to further develop in the near future. We will have to think about monetizing the app to neutralize the cost. Also it is reliant on a user base, so we will have to think about anchoring it to get a consumer base possibly with the help of the school.
