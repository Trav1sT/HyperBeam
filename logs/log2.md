### Sprint review and retrospective

Expectation of mentor: Finish up all app frames by Sprint 3 as well as integration with backend 
so that the app is deployable. Lower priorities functions can be pushed back but UI/UX should be
done too. This is so that Sprint 4 can be used for testing and prepare other materials for submission.

Backlog to be brought forward from Sprint 2 to Sprint 3:
* Upload files with G-drive
* Dummy screens and UI

New suggestions if time permits:
* Take reference from Kahoot for sharing of quizzes.
* Have the quiz avail in explore if it's public. If it is private, it is shared through invitation.
* Quiz history
* CLosed alpha and open beta testing
* Deploy on app testing sites

Priority and focus:
1. Allow users to use references to annotations in pdf files as the answer to question(Main product feature)
